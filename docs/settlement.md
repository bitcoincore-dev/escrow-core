# Settlement

## Paths

## Programs

## Contract Virtual Machine (CVM)

The purpose of the CVM is to provide members with a forum for debating the settlement of an active contract.

The paths that are available for settlement are outlined in the `templates` section of the contract. These templates are constructed using the `paths` and `payments` specified in the proposal, plus the agent `fees` specified in the contract.

The `programs` section outlines what actions can be taken, on which paths, plus the criteria required for executing a given program.

In order to command a `program` to execute an action on a given path, a member must submit a signed statement to the CVM. Depending on the program's criteria, it may require statements from multiple members.

## Verification
